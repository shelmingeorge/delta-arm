Kinda tiny robo-arm project.


This is a 3-axis robo-arm with these modules:
two Nema 17 23 mm stepping motors;
Nema 17 40 mm stepping motor;
SG90 servo motor;
three A4988 motor encoders;
3 AS5600 magnetic rotary encoders;  
PD / QC PPS / QC4+ Type-C USB trigger pad for power supply;
TCA9548A / PCA9548A multiplexer;
Mini360 voltage convertor for servo;
Arduino Uno;
laptop for controlling manipulator.



Libraries:

All other elements but bearings, screws and nuts are 3-d printed with PLA.

Mechanical part is done. Direct control works fine but some improvements are needed.
I will continue updating the code, but tecnically the project has achieved its main goal.


part 2 - neural network setting in raspberry pi 4


python libraries:

picamera2, opencv-python, tensorflow, ultralytics, ultralytics[export]  - installed by pip
